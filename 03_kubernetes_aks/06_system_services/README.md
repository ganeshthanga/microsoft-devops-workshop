# System Services

One of the many benefits to Kubernetes is that many of its components are running on Kubernetes itself. There are many pre-installed components, depending on how you bring your cluster up, and many more external add ons, that tie into third party services, or add cluster level event handling.

With some know-how, you can also develop your own cluster services, for custom needs.
